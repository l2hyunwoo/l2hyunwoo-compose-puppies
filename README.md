<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
**Make UI Code with Kotlin**
- I had imagined that I could create a UI that consisted of Kotlin.
- It was very impressive experience that UI composed of only Kotlin Code.
- It was more difficult than "XML" but it was enough to stimulate my curiosity.


**Navigating with State**
- I was confused of making navigating code from one to another screen
- But when I finished making it, it feels more reasonable than that I using nowadays.
